# 🧠 Clinical Survival Analysis: Insights from Real-World Patient Data

## 🗂️ Project Overview
This project analyzes a small clinical discovery cohort of 30 patients to uncover trends in survival outcomes using Kaplan-Meier estimation and statistical testing.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and prepare survival data
- Explore patient characteristics and survival durations
- Identify patterns by sex and tumor stage
- Visualize findings with professional, clinical-style charts

## 🔍 Key Insights
| Insight                | Summary                                                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Survival Duration   | Most patients survived 1,000–3,000 days; some exceeded 4,000 |
| ⚰️ Status Comparison   | Alive patients had longer median survival times              |
| 🧬 Tumor Stage Prevalence | Stages T2N2MX, T2N1MX most common                        |
| 🚻 Stage vs Sex        | Distribution generally balanced between sexes               |

## 📊 Visualizations Included
- Histogram of survival times
- Boxplot: Dead vs Alive comparison
- Bar chart: Tumor stage frequency
- Grouped bar chart: Tumor stage distribution by sex
- Kaplan-Meier survival curves

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Lifelines)
- Excel (initial review)
- Jupyter Notebook (code + explanation)

## 🏁 Next Steps
- Apply Cox Proportional Hazards Model
- Deploy as interactive dashboard (Streamlit)
- Collaborate with domain experts for clinical significance
